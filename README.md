React app was initally built to test dark/light theming
has persistance via writing a cookie to local storage with the token {kamsTheme: integer}

Acts a sort of template / boilerplating
Can have more than binary themes, ex: themes are put into a array ['dark', 'light', 'superLight']
button will increase an integer that indexes said array.
